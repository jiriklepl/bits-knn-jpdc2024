# Algorithms

In this document, we describe the proposed algorithms and the other evaluated algorithms used in the benchmarks. To use the proposed algorithms outside the benchmarking setup, the implementations of the proposed algorithms in the `include/bits` directory can be included in the user's codebase and used without further dependencies (except those include in their respective headers and the CUDA toolkit).


## Proposed algorithms

The benchmarking binary `knn` described in [knn.md](knn.md) can run the following proposed algorithms for top-k selection and k-NN search (fused top-k selection with L2 distance computation):

- The proposed `bits` algorithm for top-k selection
  - In the benchmarking binary `knn`, the `bits` algorithm with prefetching enabled is run with the `-a bits-prefetch` argument
    - `-a bits` runs the algorithm without prefetching; their performance is quite similar on the tested problems
  - Implemented in the  `bits_kernel` kernel in [include/bits/topk/singlepass/detail/bits_kernel.cuh](include/bits/topk/singlepass/detail/bits_kernel.cuh), line 320
  - In the visualized benchmarks, we always enable prefetching and we set block size and batch size (items per thread) parametersbased on the [tuning experiments](../README.md#optional-tuning-the-algorithm-parameters).

- The optimized partial Bitonic sort algorithm variants `baseline`, `warp-shuffle` and `sort-in-registers` performing top-k selection
  - In the benchmarking binary `knn`, the algorithms are run with the `-a partial-bitonic`, `-a partial-bitonic-warp-static`, and `-a partial-bitonic-regs` arguments, respectively
  - All implemented in [src/topk/singlepass/partial_bitonic.cu](src/topk/singlepass/partial_bitonic.cu)

- The `bits-fused` algorithm for k-NN search (fused top-k selection with L2 distance computation)
  - In the benchmarking binary `knn`, the proposed fused algorithm is run with the `-a fused-cache` argument
  - Implemented in the `fused_cache_kernel` struct in [include/bits/topk/singlepass/fused_cache_kernel_structs.cuh](include/bits/topk/singlepass/fused_cache_kernel_structs.cuh), line 666
  - Entry point is the `launch_fused_cache` kernel in [include/bits/topk/singlepass/detail/fused_cache_kernel.cuh](include/bits/topk/singlepass/detail/fused_cache_kernel.cuh), line 27
  - In the visualized benchmarks, we always set its parameters based on the [tuning experiments](../README.md#optional-tuning-the-algorithm-parameters).

The implementations of the proposed algorithms in the `include/bits` directory can be included in the user's codebase

## Other evaluated algorithms

Here is a list of the evaluated algorithms used in the benchmarks other than the proposed algorithms `bits` and `bits-fused`, and the optimized partial Bitonic sort algorithms.

State-of-the-Art algorithms for top-k selection evaluated in the paper:

- `BlockSelect` from the FAISS library; proposed by Johnson et al. (2012)
  - called in [include/bits/topk/singlepass/detail/warp_select.cuh](include/bits/topk/singlepass/detail/warp_select.cuh)'
  - in the benchmarking binary `knn`, the algorithm is run with the `-a block-select-tunable` argument (we tune the block size and the thread queues parameters)
- `AIR-topk` (radix select_k) from the RAFT library; proposed by Zhang et al. (2023)
  - called in [src/topk/multipass/air_topk.cu](src/topk/multipass/air_topk.cu)
  - in the benchmarking binary `knn`, the algorithm is run with the `-a air-topk` argument
- `GridSelect` proposed by Zhang et al. (2023)
  - called in [src/topk/singlepass/grid_select.cu](src/topk/singlepass/grid_select.cu)
  - it is the only evaluated algorithm with no available source code; we use the precompiled library available at [https://github.com/ZhangJingrong/gpu_topK_benchmark/blob/master/third_party/libgridselect.so](https://github.com/ZhangJingrong/gpu_topK_benchmark/blob/master/third_party/libgridselect.so)
  - in the benchmarking binary `knn`, the algorithm is run with the `-a grid-select` argument

Distance computation algorithms evaluated in the paper (state-of-the-art and a naive baseline):

- `baseline`: a naive implementation of the distance computation; each distance computed by a separate thread
  - called in [src/distance/baseline_distance.cu](src/distance/baseline_distance.cu)
  - in the benchmarking binary `knn`, the algorithm is run with the `-a baseline-dist` argument

- The modified MAGMA GEMM kernel for distance computation used by bf-knn; proposed by Li et al. (2015)
  - called in [src/distance/magma_distance.cu](src/distance/magma_distance.cu)
  - we consider a variant that expands the distance computation formula into $||x-y||^2 = ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 - 2 x^T y$ and leaves out the query vector norm as it does not affect the top-k selection
    - reimplemented in [include/bits/distance/abstract_gemm.cuh](include/bits/distance/abstract_gemm.cuh); this implementation routhly corresponds to the kernel in [https://github.com/geomlab-ucd/bf-knn/blob/master/bf_knn_device.cu](https://github.com/geomlab-ucd/bf-knn/blob/master/bf_knn_device.cu)
